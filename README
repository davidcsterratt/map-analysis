Map analysis code
=================

This directory contains the code for Willshaw &al. (2013) "Analysis of
local and global topographic order in mouse retinocollicular maps".

Each directory contains the following:

* lib: The core code. 

* cang: Code specific to analysis of the data of Cang &al (2008). To
  generate figures, type "figures" at Matlab prompt.  To generate a
  CSV file of statistics ("summary_stats.csv"), type
  "get_summary_stats([])". 

* misc: An R script to extract statistics presented in the paper from
  the "summary_stats.csv" file generated as explained above. To run
  the script, start R and type 'source("analyse-summary-stats.R")'.

* old: Redundant code - much can probably be dispensed with.
